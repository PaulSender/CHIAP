# P2P-Chat-Client

## Description
Version 1: A simple peer to peer chat client run on a users command prompt. 
Version 2: 
  - What: A peer to peer chat client with multiple clients and one server. All parties can communicate, and the server has special funcitionality. The program will then be integrated into a java GUI
  - Why: Version 1 of the chat client was too boring and simple. Our effors hope to bring the client into a working application that anyone can accesss anywhere (Web or Andriod) so long as the server is running. 
  - How: Multiple messages through one client and multiple clients will be done through a techneque called multithreading. Server funtionality will be done though specially defined methods within the call that get run whenever one of the clinets inputs a special keyword. GUI will be designed and implemented in Netbeans and eclipse. 
  
 ## Deliverables
  1. Create chat room that allows multiple clients to communicate to each other and to the server through server-client archtecture. 
  2. Two mini games (BlackJack and TicTacToe) that can be played in the client GUI. Winning BlackJack will award the client with a balance
  3. Integrate functionaolty into Java GUI
  
  ## Plan
   - Week 1 (October 28 - Novemebr 4th) : update code so it allows multiple messages to go through
   - Week 2 – Week 3 (Novemeber 4th - Novemebr 18th): Create the “communication triangle” to allow two unique clients to connect to 	   	one server and communicate with each other
   - Week 4 (Novemeber 18th - 25th) : Add code to a Java GUI.
   - Week 5 (Novemeber 25th - Decemeber 7th): Add as much optional features as possible until the deadline is met
