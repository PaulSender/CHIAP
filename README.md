# P2P-Chat-Client

## Description
Version 1: A simple peer to peer chat client run on a users command prompt. 
Version 2: 
  - What: A peer to peer chat client with multiple clients and one server. All parties can communicate, and the server has special funcitionality. The program will then be integrated into a web applicaiton and/or a Android Mobile application. 
  - Why: Version 1 of the chat client was too boring and simple. Our effors hope to bring the client into a working application that anyone can accesss anywhere (Web or Andriod) so long as the server is running. 
  - How: Multiple messages through one client and multiple clients will be done through a techneque called multithreading. Server funtionality will be done though specially defined methods within the call that get run whenever one of the clinets inputs a special keyword. Web application will be done though a locally hosted webpage at first and time permitting onto a full functional domain. The Andriod app (time permitting) will be done through anroid studio. 
  
 ## Deliverables
  1. Update code to acheive desired functionality
  2. Integrate into Web Application
  3. Integrate into Andriod Application
  
  ## Plan
   - Week 1 (October 28 - Novemebr 4th) : update code so it allows multiple messages to go through
   - Week 2 – Week 3 (Novemeber 4th - Novemebr 18th): Create the “communication triangle” to allow two unique clients to connect to 	   	one server and communicate with each other
   - Week 4 (Novemeber 18th - 25th) : Add code to a locally hosted webpage and add web language functionality to the webpage
   - Week 5 (Novemeber 25th - Decemeber 7th): Add as much optional features as possible until the deadline is met
